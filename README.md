## Overview

The Heart Attack Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart attacks in patients. By leveraging various supervised learning algorithms, the goal is to create an accurate and reliable prediction model that can assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients. This project will use a publicly available dataset containing patient information such as age, health status, lifestyle, and medical history. The primary evaluation metric for model performance is Recall, ensuring the model's effectiveness in identifying actual heart attack cases.

## Problem Statement

A health center faces challenges in predicting heart attacks in patients, leading to delayed interventions and putting patients' lives at risk. This problem arises from the complex nature of heart attack symptoms and various risk factors, including age, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. The inability to quickly identify who is at high risk of a heart attack makes it difficult to take swift medical action. Consequently, patients may not receive the urgent care they need, which can prevent serious outcomes such as long-term disability or even death. This situation highlights the urgent need for better tools that can predict heart attacks earlier and tailor treatment according to each individual's needs.

To address this challenge, the organization aims to develop a model capable of analyzing patient data to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. By creating this algorithm, the health center will be able to thoroughly analyze various aspects of patient data, such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and physiological indicators, to identify patterns and key risk factors associated with heart attacks.

The dataset for this analysis focuses on heart attacks and contains information on patients' personal details, health status, lifestyle, and whether they have experienced a heart attack.

## Objective

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict heart attacks, selecting the best-performing model among KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The primary evaluation metric for assessing model performance is Recall, which will be used to determine the effectiveness of each model in identifying heart attack cases.
